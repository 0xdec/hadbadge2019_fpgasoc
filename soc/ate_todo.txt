The ATE is the initial contents of the flash. The flash gets pre-programmed in the factory
and is then soldered on the badge when it is assembled. It will boot up the first time
the badge is tested, and should show a testing program to indicate if everything is OK.

We need to test/do the following (V means test is implemented)

V Test internal flash (more-or-less proven by FPGA booting up)
- Test external flash pins
V PSRAM (initial psram test as is implemented in boot/rom.S)
V * Perhaps test while rest of the test screen is shown?
V USB
  * Plug into a laptop/computer/RPi/... and detect enumeration?
- Display
  * Checkerboard pattern on test screen so faults are easy to spot
- Cartridge port
  * Cartridge, as prototyped, with cross-connections
- Ext flash
  * Read ext flash, see if id is different and non-NULL
- SAO/PMOD connectors
  * Jig that plugs into the SAO and uses pogo pins for the PMOD?
V IrDA
  * Jig sends out random IrDA packets, if receive >3 different ones OK
- Buttons:
  * Circles turn green when buttons are pressed... or something
- Possible fast switch to whatever is on the cartridge if magical word
  is found
  * Can be implemented in SoC, if memtest is moved to app. Check final x
    bytes for 'secret string', if found chainboot into cart.
- HDMI
  * Simply plug in HDMI connector.
V * ToDo: fix r/b color inversion
