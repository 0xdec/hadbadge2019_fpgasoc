# Mac Toolchain Instructions

The recommended approach is to download Sean Cross' toolchain v1.6.1 (latest at the time of writing) which gives both the FPGA toolchain as well as the RISC-V one.

Add the toolchain to the front of your PATH variable.

Note that macOS Catalina requires a lot of click-through and allowing individual components to run via the "Security and Privacy" section of preferences. Alternative solution is to disable Gatekeeper all together.
